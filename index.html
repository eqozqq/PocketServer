    <h2>FAQ:</h1>

    <button class="accordion">I have portforwarded, can i check if its working?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes, in the app's main page click "Statistics" Button there is a blue button that you can use to check if your friends can join your server via public IP.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How to extract a phar file?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>In the file explorer of the app click on a .phar file and a dialog will show up for extracting the file.

        Please note some .phar files cannot be extracted.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can i portforward without router settings?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>You have 2 options</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>Enable Upnp forwarding in pocketmine.yml by updating upnp-portforwarding to true. This only works if your router has upnp support enabled</li>
        <li>Create an account at https://portmap.io/ and create a configuration and use it with Open-VPN. This is more difficult but it does not require changes. This option does not enable custom ports without payment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can see a tutorial here it is pretty easy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIuwIyt_J6U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIuwIyt_J6U</a></p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can i use custom PHP version with this app?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>No unfortunately you cannot. Because of Android-API restrictions, it is not possible for us to implement a feature to import custom PHP binaries into the app.</p>
      <p>We however always try our best to update the app as fast as possible if there are new PHP requirements.</p>
      <p>If you need a custom PocketServer app version with custom PHP extensions, dm us at Discord and we will create a custom version of the app with different PHP binaries free for you.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">When i tap "Start server" it brings be to the console and there is not text / it is empty</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Your device is 32 bit and cannot be supported. We cannot fix this.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How can i improve the performance of my server?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Since this server runs on your device, performance is strongly limited. Smartphones and tablets are not good at hosting servers.</p>
      <p>In general, plugins, worlds, device hardware, player count, server configuration will affect the server performance. Do not expect Intel I11 like CPU performance. The server is not running on a computer.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can this app run a server for Java Edition?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>No. This app will only run server for Bedrock and Windows Edition.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can i use Omlet Arcade with this server?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Omlet arcade will cause issues with the server.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Why is my server so laggy?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This app is <b>not a gaming server</b>. The <b>server runs on your device</b>. Therefore do not expect performance like from gaming PC's or high end servers.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How can i change IP address?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This app is <b>NOT</b> a gaming server. There is <b>no reason or benefit</b> for changing IP addresses for a local server. If you have a cloud server, you can use a provider like No-IP</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How can i change the name of the server?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Go to the files -> open the <b>server.properties</b> file and edit motd value.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">I have my own server software, can you add it on your app?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>We will be more than happy to add your serversoftware inside our app. Contact us via mail or join us on Discord.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How do i get Admin / OP on my server?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>To be an Admin on your server, open the app -> Console and run the command: op YourInGameName</p>
      <p>Replace YourInGameName with your actual username.</p>
      <p>If your username contains spaces like "Gamer Pro", then wrap your name inside " ". like: op "Gamer Pro"</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Why are there no mobs and some items are missing</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The serversoftware inside the app is not ment to be used as a vanilla server. Mobs and some items are not supported. We cannot "fix" this.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Server does not start</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>Some plugins may cause your server to shutdown while starting it. Please remove all your plugins first and try starting the server again.</li>
        <p>If you experience any issues with a plugin, please contact the plugin developer.</p>
        <p>The plugins available on this app are made by third-party developers wich are not connected with us.</p>
        <li>Your device has a 32-Bit CPU. The server software used in this app does not support 32 bit devices. We cannot change this.</li>
        <li>Check modified files. Incorrect modification of certain files may cause your server to shutdown.</li>
        <li>Always use the latest alpha versions. Older versions are not maintained and may cause internal issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">My server is automatically stopping when the app is in background</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Please disable battery optimization for this app if you want the server to run while in background. The app will ask you to disable it when opening and starting the server.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How can i fix "Login Timeout"?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Please use the default skin and try joining again.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can i publish my own plugin in your app?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>If you publish your plugin on poggit, it will be automatically  available on the app. We however give you the oppurtunity to publish your own plugin in our app. Simply contact us via mail or on Discord.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Please add support for 1.1.5</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>1.1.5 was removed from the application long time ago. It was removed because it required additional PHP binaries wich just increase the app size by 50% and not everyone is using 1.1.5.</p>
      <p>There were a lot of complaints of this and that not working leaving us with the decision to remove this version. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Why is the app crashing?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>If the app is crashing, please send us a screenshot or video of producing the crash. Also include some details about your device and contact us on Discord or via mail.</p>
      <p>Mail: <a href="mailto:thedestroyermcpe@gmail.com">thedestroyermcpe@gmail.com</a></p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Please add support for 32 Bit devices</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>We cannot add support for 32 Bit devices. Please consider buying a newer device. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">There are many ads, can you remove ads pls?</button>
    <div class="panel">

    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Plugin X / Y does not work, can you fix it?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>No we cannot fix any issues related to plugins since they are not made by us. Contact the plugin developer please for any questions or issues.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What can i use this app for?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>You can use this app for developing and debugging plugins on your device, test different components of a server, or you can develop worlds for your production server.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">I'm trying to invite my friends but they cannot join</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>We do not recommend to use this application as a means to host the server for gaming. Use cloud services instead. If you still want other people to join your server wich are on a different network, you must setup portforwarding. This step cannot be explained here since for every network, the way of setting this up will be different.</p>
      <p>You can find a well explained guide on the following link: <a href="https://portforward.com" target="_blank">https://portforward.com</a></p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Why are there 2 different IP's of my server? What are these?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>On a IPv4 network, there are is a local and public IP.</p>
      <p>The local IP is ment to identify you device in a local network, it cannot accesed on the internet. Use the local IP to join your server.</p>
      <p>The public IP can be accessed over the internet. Use it to invite other people outside your network. (Portforwarding required first)</p>
      <p>You do not need to use these IP's to join your server. The server will be automatically shown on the friends tab in the game.</p>
      <p>These IP's are ment to be used for development or testing. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can i be staff on the discord server?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>No.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Why are you copying PocketMine-MP app?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This app is not a copy of the PocketMine-MP app. All apps including our app wich start a PocketMine-MP server are inofficial apps. They are not maintained by the developer of PocketMine-MP.</p>
      <p>PocketMine-MP is also not an app, it is a server software wich allows you to run a server for the game.  If you do not understand, do not use this app.</p>
      <p>Also most of the features inside PocketServer were added before the other app implemented these.</p>
      <p>View for more information. <a href="https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/stable/LICENSE" target="_blank">https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/stable/LICENSE</a></p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How can i move all files outside the app?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Starting from Android 11, apps can no longer access /sdcard location and only can modify files in their own directories. You can however import and export your files within the app easily.</p>
      <ul class="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>Select the files that you want to export</li>
        <li>If you have multiple files and do not want to export each file manually, zip selected files</li>
        <li>Long press on the created zip file and export to external storage</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
